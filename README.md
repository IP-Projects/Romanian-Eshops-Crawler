# Romanian-Eshops-Crawler

This is a crawler written in python for Emag, Cel and PcGarage.

For now it is a hard-coded version of it useful only for finding the laptops from these websites and trying to normalize their specification data

For example:
Each site uses Nvidia Geforce in a different way, some uses Nvidia-Geforce other only Geforce etc.
This crawler tries to replace all different names with a singe one.
